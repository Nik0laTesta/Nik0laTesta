# Hi, I'm Xander

A Systems and Networking technician currently wrapping up a year-long deep dive into enterprise networking and systems administration.
Currently trying to get into the IT field. Making a Career change! Or at least trying to. 

Dus indien jij, beste lezer, een werkgever bent die graag met enthousiaste, leergierige, pientere mensen werk.. zoek niet verder! 

## About Me

My approach to tech is a mix of formal training and a "learn by breaking things" mentality in my home lab, I have the piles of broken electronics to prove it. 
I've never been satisfied with just having things work — I want to know exactly how the things function. 
If you ask someone how does this work and they say "it just does". That does not compute for me. 
It does untill it does'nt. And if you know how it is supposed to fit together and work you will be able to trouble shoot and repair if it is no longer fitting together and working.

Over the last year, I've moved past the basics and into the enterprise side of things. I spend a lot of my time in the CLI working with OSPF, VLAN segmentation, and securing the enterprise edge. On the systems side, I managed Windows Server environments with a focus on Active Directory and the AGDLP security model. I also handled Linux administration, from managing file systems to hardening system security.

## Philosophy

I'm a big believer in the "work smarter, not harder" approach. If a task needs to be done more than once, I'm probably trying to automate it. This mindset carries over into my hardware and IoT projects, where I've built everything I could think of. 

A couple fun projects can be found on this github, but even more cant. If you want to hear about the "Gyro drink protector", the time my parents almost bought a new tv for no reason, the struggles of making an arduino yourself with just the chip and many more.. You should probrably hire me. :p  
My latest project is a custom Math Clock where you have to use math to know the time, it also shows BirthDays AND you can play games like snake on it! Fun for the kids. Be sure to have a look at that one! 
Ofcourse you could just go buy anyone of these things.. But where is the fun in that?

These were just some fun projects. Now I would like to step into the IT Networking Space. To accomplish that I have been following a intense year long program where I got to encounter and play with the most used and needed protocols and architectures, giving me the technical foundation to stop just studying the network and start actually managing it.

## Approach

Whether it's bulk-provisioning users through a script or optimizing network performance, I enjoy the challenge of building and maintaining reliable, scalable systems from the ground up.
