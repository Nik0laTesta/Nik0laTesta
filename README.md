# Hi, I'm Xander

A Systems and Networking technician currently wrapping up a year-long deep dive into the Cisco CCNA stack.

## About Me

My approach to tech is a mix of formal training and a "learn by breaking things" mentality in my home lab. I've never been satisfied with just making things work — I want to know exactly how the data flows from the copper wire to the application.

Over the last year, I've moved past the basics and into the enterprise side of things. I spend a lot of my time in the CLI working with OSPF, VLAN segmentation, and securing the enterprise edge. On the systems side, I manage Windows Server environments with a focus on Active Directory and the AGDLP security model. I also handle Linux administration, from managing file systems to hardening system security.

## Philosophy

I'm a big believer in the "work smarter, not harder" approach. If a task needs to be done more than once, I'm probably writing a Bash or C# script to automate it. This mindset carries over into my hardware and IoT projects, where I've built everything from a motion-triggered wildlife camera system on a Raspberry Pi to a custom Math Clock using an ATMega328P. I'm just as comfortable with a soldering iron and a breadboard as I am configuring a trunk port or a GPO.

## Technical Skills

### Networking
- OSPF, STP, EtherChannel
- VLAN segmentation and inter-VLAN routing
- Enterprise edge security
- Cisco IOS CLI configuration

### Systems Administration
- **Windows Server**: Active Directory, AGDLP security model, Group Policy
- **Linux**: File system management, security hardening
- DNS, DHCP configuration and management

### Development & Automation
- **Languages**: Python, C++, C#, Bash scripting
- Automation-first mindset for repetitive tasks
- Custom solutions for infrastructure challenges

### Hardware & IoT
- Arduino/ATMega328P projects
- Raspberry Pi systems
- Circuit design and soldering

## Approach

Whether it's bulk-provisioning users through a script or optimizing network performance, I enjoy the challenge of building and maintaining reliable, scalable systems from the ground up.
